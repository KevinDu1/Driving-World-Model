# Driving-World-Model
The code and dataset of the manuscript "Driving World Model: A Generative End-to-End Method for Autonomous Driving"

The performance of end-to-end autonomous driving paradigms is often constrained in complex and dynamic urban environments due to limited generalization and decision-making capabilities, to address this issue, this study presents the Driving World Model (DWM), enhances the decision-making capabilities of end-to-end autonomous driving algorithms by combining the world model with the neural controller.
